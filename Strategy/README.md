## Strategy Pattern ##

From Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern):
- defines a family of algorithms,
- encapsulates each algorithm, and
- makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.

This example actually isn't an algorythm at all, so perhaps the use of the strategy pattern is completely off.. ?
